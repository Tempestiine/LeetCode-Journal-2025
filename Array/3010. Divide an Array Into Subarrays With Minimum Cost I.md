### ðŸ”— Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

The cost of an array is the value of its first element. You can only divide an array into 3 subarrays. Return the minimum possible sum of the cost of these arrays. You can not reorder the array.

**Example 1**
Input: `nums = [1,2,3,12]`
Output: `6`
Explanation: `The best possible way to form 3 subarrays is: [1], [2], and [3, 12] at a total cost of 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

**Constraints**
- 3 <= n <= 50
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 50

### ðŸ§  My Thought Process

No matter what, the first element of the array `nums` will always be included. I just need to find the next two minimum elements that will represent the second and third minimum possible costs by traversing the array `nums`.

### ðŸ§ª Code (Java) [ACCEPTED]

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumCost(int[] nums) {
        int a = 1; // Second Possible Array Starting Index
        int b = a + 1; // Third Possible Array Starting Index
        int i = b + 1;
        while (i < nums.length) {
            if (nums[i] < Math.max(nums[a], nums[b]))
                if (nums[a] > nums[b])
                    a = i;
                else
                    b = i;
            i++;
        }
        return nums[0] + nums[a] + nums[b];
    }
}
```
