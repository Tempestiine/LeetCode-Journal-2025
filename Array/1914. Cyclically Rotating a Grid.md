### ðŸ”— Problem Description

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`â€‹â€‹â€‹, where `m` and `n` are both even integers, and an integer `k`. **Please look at the link to the LeetCode problem to see the official picture.**

The matrix is composed of several layers. A cyclic rotation of the matrix is done by cyclically rotating each layer in the matrix. To cyclically rotate a layer once, each element in the layer will take the place of the adjacent element in the counter-clockwise direction. 


**Example 1:**  
Input: `grid = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16]], k = 2`
Output: `[[3,4,8,12],[2,11,10,16],[1,7,6,15],[5,9,13,14]]`

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= m, n <= 50`
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`

### ðŸ§  My Thought Process [PT. 1]

I'll rotate the grid by shifting every element counterclockwise and dividing the grid into subarrays. I'll rotate the grid from the outermost ring to the innermost ring. I do not believe there are any shortcuts I can take to solve this problem.

### ðŸ§ª Code (Java) [PT. 1, FAILED]

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] rotateGrid(int[][] grid, int k) {
        int temp[][] = grid;
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        for (int start = 0; start < k; start++) { // K Iterations

            // Rotation Code ------------------------
            int B = 0; // Boundaries or Edges
            while (B != Math.min(m, n) / 2) {
                int first = temp[0 + B][0 + B];
                // TOP
                for (int x = B; x < n - 1 - B; x++)
                    temp[B][x] = temp[B][x + 1];
                // RIGHT
                for (int x = B; x < m - 1 - B; x++)
                    temp[x][n - 1 - B] = temp[x + 1][n - 1 - B];
                // BOTTOM
                for (int x = n - 1 - B; x > B; x--)
                    temp[m - 1 - B][x] = temp[m - 1 - B][x - 1];
                // LEFT
                for (int x = m - 1 - B; x > 1 + B; x--)
                    temp[x][B] = temp[x - 1][B];
                temp[1 + B][B] = first;
                // Incrementing Variables
                B++;
            } // Rotation Code --------------------------
        }
        return temp;
    }
}
```

### ðŸ§  My Thought Process [PT. 2]

I was shocked that my code failed. I accurately implemented the solution, but my code took too long to run against a few sets of data. I did not entertain the possibility that a matrix could be rotated hundreds or thousands of times.

I found a solution to cut the runtime. Imagine this: you have a watch which reads 7:00AM. You're told to add 2 hours to the watch, so you add 2 hours so that the watch reads 9:00AM because it makes sense logically. Instead, if you were told to add 26 hours, you would only just add 2 hours because it wouldn't make sense for you to change the watch by an entire day and do extra work. (26 - 24 = 2).

What about 50 hours, given that your watch reads 7:00AM? Then, you would only add two hours based on this equation: 50 % 24 = 2. We can apply this logic to the LeetCode problem. 

### ðŸ§ª Code (Java) [FINAL, ACCEPTED]

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] rotateGrid(int[][] grid, int k) { // What if K was 99999999?
        int temp[][] = grid;
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;

        // Rotation Code ------------------------
        int B = 0; // Boundaries or Edges
        while (B != Math.min(m, n) / 2) {
            int perimeter = 2*(n - 2*B) + 2*(m - 2*B) - 4; // Perimeter Length, no overlapping corners
            int e = k % perimeter; // Optimize rotations
            for (int start = 0; start < e; start++) {
                int first = temp[0 + B][0 + B];
                // TOP
                for (int x = B; x < n - 1 - B; x++)
                    temp[B][x] = temp[B][x + 1];
                // RIGHT
                for (int x = B; x < m - 1 - B; x++)
                    temp[x][n - 1 - B] = temp[x + 1][n - 1 - B];
                // BOTTOM
                for (int x = n - 1 - B; x > B; x--)
                    temp[m - 1 - B][x] = temp[m - 1 - B][x - 1];
                // LEFT
                for (int x = m - 1 - B; x > 1 + B; x--)
                    temp[x][B] = temp[x - 1][B];
                temp[1 + B][B] = first;
            }
            // Incrementing Variables
            B++;
        } // Rotation Code --------------------------
        return temp;
    }
}
```
