### ðŸ”— Problem Description

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. You have a starting score of 0.

In one *operation*:
- Choose an index `i` such that `0 <= i < nums.length`.
- Increase your score by `nums[i]`.
- Replace `nums[i]` with `Math.ceil(nums[i] / 3)`.

Return the maximum possible score you can attain after applying exactly `k` operations.

**Example 1:**  
Input: `nums = [10,10,10,10,10], k = 5`
Output: `50`  
Explanation: `Apply the operation to each array element exactly once. The final score is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50.`

**Example 2:**  
Input: `nums = [1,10,3,3,3], k = 3`  
Output: `17`
Explanation: `You can do the following operations:
Operation 1: Select i = 1, so nums becomes [1,4,3,3,3]. Your score increases by 10.
Operation 2: Select i = 1, so nums becomes [1,2,3,3,3]. Your score increases by 4.
Operation 3: Select i = 2, so nums becomes [1,2,1,3,3]. Your score increases by 3.
The final score is 10 + 4 + 3 = 17.`

**Constraints**:

- `1 <= nums.length, k <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

### ðŸ§  My Thought Process [PT. 1]

Immediately, I knew I had to use a PriorityQueue. A PriorityQueue is a data structure that automatically sorts elements. If I kept getting the maximum value from `nums` through a PriorityQueue, I would always get the maximum score. However, I realized that PriorityQueues only allow me to access elements with the least value. So, I tried using an iterator, but I came across a ton of issues with this approach.

### ðŸ§ª Code (Java) [PT. 1, FAILED]

```java
class Solution {
    public long maxKelements(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Creating a PriorityQueue and Iterator
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<Integer>();
        Iterator<Integer> x = pq.iterator();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            pq.add(i);
            if (i != 0)
                x.next(); // Move the iterator almost to the end
        }
        // Calculating the maximum sum
        // Convert integers to Long
        Long sum = 0L;
        int val;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
             val = x.remove(); // .remove() does not return anything from iterators
             pq.add(val / 3);
             sum = sum + val;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### ðŸ§  My Thought Process [PT. 2]

I wish I could change change the PriorityQueue class to give me elements with the maximum value. Then, I thought outside of the box, and I could redefine what maximum and minimum meant. If PriorityQueues will only give me elements with the smallest value, I would make PriorityQueues believe that numbers with small values are HUGE and numbers with huge values are SMALL.

Basically, I needed to create my own class that implements Comparable with objects that encapsulated numbers in the array nums.

### ðŸ§ª Code (Java) [FINAL, ACCEPTED]

```java
class Solution {
    public long maxKelements(int[] nums, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<MyBox> pq = new PriorityQueue(); // Create a PriorityQueue
        for (int i : nums) { // Adding the values
            MyBox current = new MyBox(i);
            pq.add(current);
        }
        // Adding and Removing values
        Long sum = 0L; 
        for (int x = 0; x < k; x++) {
            MyBox current = pq.remove(); // Tricks PriorityQueue to remove Maximum Value
            sum += current.getData();
            current = new MyBox((int) (Math.ceil(current.getData() / 3.0)));
            pq.add(current);
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

class MyBox implements Comparable {
    private int data;
    public MyBox(int i) {
        data = i;
    }
    public int getData() {
        return data;
    }
    public int setData(int i) {
        data = i;
        return data;
    }
    // Numbers such as 10 have greater value than numbers likes 1
    public int compareTo(Object o) {
        MyBox other = (MyBox) o;
        return other.data - this.data;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return "" + data;
    }
}
```

### ðŸ§  Reflection

I referred to `@Sahil Bassan`'s solution (LeetCode).

Apparently, there was a faster way to solve this problem.

```java
PriorityQueue<Integer> queue = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
```

This reverses the order of a PriorityQueue so that the biggest elements are at the head. Amusingly, my code is comparatively quick (132ms, Beats 63.73%), but it takes more memory (63.25 MB, Beats 39.22%). People who reverse the order of a PriortyQueue have slower code, but their approaches take less memory.

- I learned how to effectively create custom classes and manipulate them.
- I learned more about PriorityQueues
