### ðŸ”— Problem Description

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**  
Input: `x = 121`  
Output: `true`  

**Example 2:**  
Input: `x = -121`  
Output: `false`
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.

### ðŸ§  My Thought Process [PT. 1]

I went straight to Manacher's Algorithm, which was overkill. My code could have been simplified, but my submission was accepted.

### ðŸ§ª Code (Java) [PT. 1, ACCEPTED]

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return false;
        String xStr = "" + x;
        String test = "$" + xStr.replaceAll("", "#") + "@";
        int[] P = new int[test.length()];
        int R = 0, C = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= test.length() / 2; i++) {
            int mirror = 2 * C - i;
            if (i < R)
                P[i] = Math.min(R - i, P[mirror]);
            while (test.charAt(i + (1 + P[i])) == test.charAt(i - (1 + P[i])))
                P[i]++;
            if (P[i] + i > R) {
                C = i;
                R = i + P[i];
            }
        }
        int half = test.length() / 2;
        return P[half] == xStr.length();
    }
}
```

### ðŸ§  My Thought Process [FINAL]

I referred to `@Niits`'s solution, and I learned that I could have compared the given integer to a flipped version of itself using multiplication, division, and addition operator.

### ðŸ§ª Code (Java) [FINAL, ACCEPTED]

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return false;
        int reverse = 0;
        int copy = x;
        while (copy > 0) {
            reverse = (reverse * 10) + (copy % 10);
            copy /= 10;
        }
        return reverse == x;
    }
}
```

### ðŸ§  Reflection
- I learned about how to traverse the digits of an integer effectively
