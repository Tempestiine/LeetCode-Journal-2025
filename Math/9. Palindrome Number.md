### ðŸ”— Problem Description

Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

**Example 1:**  
Input: `s = "babad"`  
Output: `bab`  
Explanation: `"aba" is also a valid answer.`

**Example 2:**  
Input: `s = "cbbd"`  
Output: `bb`

**Constraints**
- `s` contains of only digits and English letters

### ðŸ§  My Thought Process

As much as I wanted to use recursive methods, the problem required `Dynamic Programming`. Dynamic Programming means using optimized algorithms for solutions instead of plain recursion because Dynamic Programming saves a bunch of space and time for large datasets.

Honestly, I couldn't create any simple algorithms from scratch to determine whether a substring was palindromic. I referred to `@IDeserve`'s video "Longest Palindromic Substring O(N) Manacher's Algorithm" (YouTube). Below, I adapted his idea to my code.

The Manacher's Algorithm is based on this one observation: Palindrome's are symmetrical. The lengths of POSSIBLE palindromes on the right-side of a selected and DEFINITE palindrome are AT LEAST the same length as DEFINITE palindromes on the left-side. Although this fact may seem trivial, when implementing it practically, a person can save tons of iterations.

### ðŸ§ª Code (Java) [ACCEPTED]

```java
class Solution {
    public String longestPalindrome(String s) { // Manacher's Algorithm
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) return "";
	// Between every character, before and after the string, make a '#'.
	// At the front and back of the string, make two unique symbols representing the start and end.
        String test = new String("$" + s.replaceAll("", "#") + "@");
        int[] P = new int[test.length()]; // Tracks Palindrome lengths
        int C = 0, R = 0; // Center, Right Boundary
        int maxLen = 0, centerIndex = 0; // Max Length, Max Center Index
        for (int i = 1; i < test.length() - 1; i++) { // Iterate and find lengths
            int mirror = 2 * C - i;
            if (i < R) // Uses symmetry to skip iterations
                P[i] = Math.min(R - i, P[mirror]);
	    // Expand from the index and find the biggest possible palindrome.
            while (test.charAt(i + (1 + P[i])) == test.charAt(i - (1 + P[i])))
                P[i]++;
            if (i + P[i] > R) {
                C = i;
                R = i + P[i];
            }
            // Track max length and its center
            if (P[i] > maxLen) {
                maxLen = P[i];
                centerIndex = i;
            }
        }
        // Convert Translated String back to OG string
        int start = (centerIndex - maxLen) / 2;
        return s.substring(start, start + maxLen);
    }
}
```
