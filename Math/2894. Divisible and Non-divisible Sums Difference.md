### ðŸ”— Problem Description

You are given positive integers n and m.

Define two integers as follows:

`num1`: The sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` (both inclusive) that are not divisible by `m`.
`num2`: The sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` (both inclusive) that are divisible by `m`.
Return the integer `num1 - num2.

**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 10, m = 3`
Output: `19`
Explanation: In the given example:
- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are not divisible by 3 are [1,2,4,5,7,8,10], num1 is the sum of those integers = 37.
- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3 are [3,6,9], num2 is the sum of those integers = 18.
We return 37 - 18 = 19 as the answer.

**Constraints**
- `1 <= n, m <= 1000`

### ðŸ§  My Thought Process

Writing a for-loop, I'll count every number until I reach those positive integers, and I will adjust sum based on the restrictions on what needs to be added or subtracted to sum.

### ðŸ§ª Code (Java) [ACCEPTED]

```java
class Solution {
    public int differenceOfSums(int n, int m) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int x = 1; x <= n; x++)
            if (x % m != 0)
                sum += x;
        for (int y = 1; y <= n; y++)
            if (y % m == 0)
                sum -= y;
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### ðŸ§  Reflection
- I learned how to properly use a for-loop.
- I'm going to aim for a harder problem.
