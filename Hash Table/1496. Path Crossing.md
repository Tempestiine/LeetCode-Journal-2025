### ðŸ”— Problem Description

Given a string `path`, where `path[i]` = `'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'` or `'W'`, each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin `(0, 0)` on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by `path`.

Return `true` if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited. Return `false` otherwise.

**Example 1**
Input: `path = "NES"`
Output: `false`
Explanation: `Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.

**Example 2**
Input: `path = NESWW"`
Output: `true`
Explanation: `Notice that the path visits the origin twice.`

### ðŸ§  My Thought Process [PT. 1]

Right away, I knew I had to record each coordinate on the 2D plane if I followed `path`.

### ðŸ§ª Code (Java) [PT. 1, FAILED]

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPathCrossing(String path) {
        // Creating Coordinate System
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        for (int k = 0; k < path.length(); k++) {
            String direction = path.substring(k, k + 1);
            switch (direction) { // Translating String to Coordinates
                case "N": y++; break;
                case "S": y--; break;
                case "E": x++; break;
                case "W": x--; break;
            }
            if (x == 0 && y == 0)
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### ðŸ§  My Thought Process [FINAL]

Reviewing my code, I quickly realized that I had a logic error. According to my code, only if the path intersects the origin, then my program will believe that the path intersected itself. I changed my code again. I included two lists that would keep track of the coordinates.

Below, you'll see that I used a switch statement. Switch-case is basically a structure composed of a bunch of if-statements, all simplified together. 

### ðŸ§ª Code (Java) [FINAL, ACCEPTED]

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPathCrossing(String path) {
        // Creating Coordinate System and Tracker
        int[] memoryX = new int[path.length() + 1];
        int[] memoryY = new int[path.length() + 1];
        memoryX[0] = memoryY[0] = 0; // Track Origin;
        int indX = 1, indY = 1; // Skip over the Origin
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        // Reading the String 'path'
        for (int k = 0; k < path.length(); k++) {
            String direction = path.substring(k, k + 1);
            switch (direction) { // Translating String to Coordinates
                case "N": y++; break;
                case "S": y--; break;
                case "E": x++; break;
                case "W": x--; break;
            }
            // Checking our Tracker
            int search = 0;
            while (search < memoryX.length) {
                if (memoryX[search] == x && memoryY[search] == y)
                    return true;
                search++;
            }
            // If we find new coordinates, put it in the tracker.
            memoryX[indX++] = x;
            memoryY[indY++] = y;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### ðŸ§  Reflection
- Compared to other people, I noticed that people used ArrayLists to keep track or used a structure called Pairs. However, the differences between my code and their code in terms of memory and time was tiny.
- I learned more about how to properly use switch-case.
