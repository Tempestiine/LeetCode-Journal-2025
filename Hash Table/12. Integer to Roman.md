### ðŸ”— Problem Description

Given an integer, convert it into a Roman numeral.

Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:

| Symbol | Value |
|--------|-------|
| I      | 1     |
| V      | 5     |
| X      | 10    |
| L      | 50    |
| C      | 100   |
| D      | 500   |
| M      | 1000  |

Roman numerals also have a subtractive form, which is detailed below.

| Symbol | Value |
|--------|-------|
| IV     | 4     |
| IX     | 9     |
| XL     | 40    |
| XC     | 90    |
| CD     | 400   |
| CM     | 900   |

**Example 1:**  
Input: `num = 3749`
Output: `"MMMDCCXLIX"`

**Example 2:**  
Input: `num = 58`
Output: `"LVIII"`

**Constraints**
- 1 <= num <= 3999

### ðŸ§  My Thought Process [PT. 1]

The problem made sense in my head: looked easy, seemed easy. I believed using a `Map` would be the best way to find the solution. I planned to subtract the greatest possible value which represented a roman numeral from integer, which meant I needed to traverse a map. However, I quickly realized that this approach was nearly impossible.

I referred to `@niits`'s solution (LeetCode) and modified my code.

### ðŸ§ª Code (Java) [PT. 1, FAILED]

```java
class Solution {
    public String intToRoman(int num) {
        Map<String, Integer> convert = new HashMap<String, Integer>;
        convert.put(1, "I");
        convert.put(4, "IV");
        convert.put(5, "V");
        convert.put(9, "IX");
        convert.put(10, "X");
        convert.put(40, "XL");
        convert.put(50, "L");
        convert.put(90, "XC");
        convert.put(100, "C");
        convert.put(400, "CD");
        convert.put(500, "D");
        convert.put(900, "CM");
        convert.put(1000, "M");
        int temp = number;
    }
    public int getNumber(int n) {
        while (temp != 0) {
            // How am I going to traverse this?
        }
    }
}
```

### ðŸ§  My Thought Process [FINAL]

I was shocked that I could use two arrays to find an integer's corresponding roman numeral. It seemed simpler than I had thought. Although there is no mapping involved, this approach would get the job done.

---

### ðŸ§ª Code (Java) [FINAL, ACCEPTED]

```java
class Solution {
    // Set values for pairs of numbers and roman numerals
    final int[] NUMBERS = {1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1};
    final String[] SYMBOLS = {"M", "CM", "D",  "CD", "C", "XC", "L", "XL", "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I"};

    public String intToRoman(int num) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        // Calculating Roman Numeral
        int n = num;
        int i = 0;
        while (i < NUMBERS.length && n != 0) {
            while (n >= NUMBERS[i]) {
                sb.append(SYMBOLS[i]);
                n -= NUMBERS[i];
            }
            i++;
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```
