# ðŸ§  LeetCode Journal 2025

Hi! I'm working through LeetCode problems in Java to sharpen my problem-solving and coding skills as I prepare for college and beyond. For Background, I completed AP Computer Science A, understand basic algorithms and data structures, and I'm studying for the OCA Java SE 8 Programmer 1 Exam.

This repo is just to help me be consistent and thoughtful with my growth. Some days I finish one, some days I just try. Either way, I'll log what I learn here. Each problem I do in LeetCode is recorded them in readable `.md` files, which are contained by folders consisting of their overall nature. The folders are just ranked by their Question ID.

## Structure

Each folder = most popular topic (Arrays, String, Math, Sorting).

Each file = one problem, with % Acceptances AND notes AND reflection AND code

---

## Goals

- Practice CS fundamentals regularly
- Write clean, understandable code
- Reflect on common patterns and mistakes
- Aim for **reasonable** optimization of Memory and Time
