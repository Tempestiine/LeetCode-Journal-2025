# ðŸ§  LeetCode Journal 2025

Hi! I'm working through LeetCode problems in Java to sharpen my problem-solving and coding skills as I prepare for college and beyond. For Background, I completed AP Computer Science A, understand basic algorithms and data structures, and I'm studying for the OCA Java SE 8 Programmer 1 Exam.

This repo is just to help me be consistent and thoughtful with my growth. Some days I finish one, some days I just try. Either way, I'll log what I learn here. Most importantly, each problem will increase in difficulty gradually. Each problem I do in LeetCode is recorded them in readable `.md` files, which are contained by folders consisting of their overall nature. Basically, in these folders, the topmost files carries older and easier problems. The bottommost files contain harder problems that are more recent.

## Structure

Each folder = most popular topic (Arrays, String, Math, Sorting).

Each file = one problem, with % Acceptances AND notes AND reflection AND code

---

## Goals

- Practice CS fundamentals regularly
- Write clean, understandable code
- Reflect on common patterns and mistakes
- Aim for **reasonable** optimization of Memory and Time
