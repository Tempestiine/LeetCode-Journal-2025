# ðŸ§  LeetCode Journal 2025

Hi! I'm working through LeetCode problems to sharpen my problem-solving and coding skills as I prep for college and beyond.

This repo isn't about doing 100 problems in 100 days or chasing streaksâ€”it's just me being consistent and thoughtful with my growth. Some days I finish one, some days I just try. Either way, I'll log what I learn here.

I'll start with easy problems. Gradually, each problem will increase in difficulty.
